## Task 0 (get familiar with Git and GitHub)
- I learned more about merging conflicts and making pull requests.
- This material was already familiar to me, but I was surprised by strange warnings and error messages. :smile:
- I intend to use all the things, that i learned during the course (I hope so).

## Task 1
- I already had some experience with command line and linux filesystem, so materials from last course (about networking) was new for me. And, frankly, very interesting.
- I was quite surprised by TCP/IP stack (and all these things).
- I will use knowledge about bash commands and the protocol stack.
